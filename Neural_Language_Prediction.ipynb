The benefit of character-based language models is their small vocabulary and flexibility in handling any words, punctuation, and other document structure. This comes at the cost of requiring larger models that are slower to train.\n",

        "When formulating my own RNN, I tried a variety of different techniques to get the best possible output while mitigating for overfitting:\n",

        "1) Using different number of memory cells\n",
        "\n",
        "Memory cells in the context of RNNs are roughly the \"# of neurons\" in the model. Therefore, intuitively, I believed it would be better to increase the number of memory cells because there would be more nodes that would account for some of the complexities within the data. However, I did not want to massively increase the number of memory cells as that would overfit. So, I increased the number of memory cells by a small amount to be at 100 versus the previous number of 75. When I ran the model with just this change, the training accuracy was slightly higher while the final model did not change in accuracy either.\n",
        "\n",
        "2) Different types and numbers of layers\n",
        "\n",
        "I knew that I wanted to add more layers to the model because it would again account for some of the hidden complexities within the model. Yet, because I already chose to increase the number of nodes, I thought to add only 1 more layer. I specifically chose to add a fully connected ReLU layer because I know that this kind of activation layer specifically accounts for any behavior that's not linear and is typically pretty efficient as it doesn't change any kind of performance among neurons that are doing a good job but only alters the nodes that do need further manipulation. I did at first try to include multiple ReLU layers but that ultimately produced a very inaccurate model output in the testing portion.\n",

        "3) Different lengths of training epochs\n",
        "\n",
        "I added a few more epochs because I believed that I was accounting for some overfitting already and wanted to ensure that the model was still getting exposure to the dataset that it needed. I settled on the epoch number of 120 because it didn't go too significantly over the starting number of 100.\n",
        "\n",
        "4) Different sequence lengths and pre-processing\n",
        "\n",
        "I changed the sequence length to be 24, the length of the first line, at first. However, it ended up performing very well on my training model and validation epochs but very poorly when we tried to generate text, showing that it had overfitted. I therefore kept the sequence length at 10 so that my model could be trained on smaller bits of the corpus and be able to understand patterns in that manner.\n",

        "5) Try regularization techniques such as Dropout\n",
        "\n",

        "I decided to run a word-level model on the well-known poem by Robert Frost, \"Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening.\" I chose this text because of its usage of older language and its focus on artistic expression rather than conveying straightforward information or forming logical connections between words. This made me anticipate that the model might face difficulties in handling this particular piece of text, making it a bit more challenging.\n",
        "\n",
        "While developing the model, I made a few choices to enhance its performance. I added extra layers, including an embedding layer, to consolidate the higher-dimensional 'word vectors' and refine the model's understanding of the language nuances. Keeping LSTM and Dense layers as additional layers introduced complexity, and including dropout layers helped prevent overfitting, ultimately improving the fluency of the generated sequences.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, my belief is that word-level models have the potential to better capture the semantic context, but only when coupled with measures to prevent overfitting and an appropriate level of complexity, as I implemented in this case. While the output was not accurate to the actual poem itself, it did seem to make some sense. The goal was to strike a balance, allowing the model to discern the subtleties of the poetic language while accounting for its inherent complexities."
