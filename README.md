# Building RNNs for Poetry

Fun fact about me: I love poetry! In this project, I created two LSTM-RNN models that predicted language for the poems "Sing a Song of Sixpence" and "Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening" by Robert Frost. In this project, I hoped to apply my knowledge of neural networks and model building to my passion of writing, and gain exposure into the world of NLP. In this project, I made use of the machine learning libraries **Tensorflow, Keras** and **h5py**. 

All details of this project can be found in the .ipynb file; however, here are the main steps I followed --

1) Sequence generation (tokenizing poems character-wise)
2) Encoding texts into integers
3) Building baseline LSTM model
4) Model improvement (adding layers, hyperparameter tuning, adding epochs, experimenting with layer types)
5) Model evaluation

Details of what methods I tried can also be found in the notebook.
